								<h2>Meet Emily</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								Emily VanVleck has been flying for 10 years. Her interest in union work started after
								she returned from furlough in
								2020. She elected to take a EVLOA and return to school to finish her bachelors degree.
								While in school, she got involved
								in social justice work, joining the board of a women’s nonprofit where she still serves.
								When she returned to the line
								in 2021 she wanted to use the knowledge she gained to streghten flight attendant power
								and fight back against
								contractual violations. She became a Base Council Representative in 2022 and soon fyer
								volunteered to be a Contract
								Action Team Base Contact.

							</p>
							<p>
								As a Contract Action Team Base Contact she built a team of Ambassadors to inform flight
								attendants about the status of
								negotiations. Between terminal walks, organizing pickets, and flying a full schedule,
								she was proud to be building trust
								with flight attendants that the union is stronger when we’re all involved. She is
								honored to be continuing her service
								to flight attendants by running for LGA Base President.

								<h2>Meet Kassie</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								Kassie began her career as a flight attendant at a regional airline in 2014, joining the
								American family in 2015 in PHX
								and then PHL. She has been based in LGA since 2020.
								Her dedication to her colleagues, passengers, and the labor movement has always been
								rooted in her commitment to care
								and community — a commitment shaped by her academic and professional background in
								social work and mental health
								advocacy.
							</p>
							<p>
								Her desire to work for change at the local level was inspired by her experiences
								navigating maternity leave after the
								births of her two young children. She fought back against an illegal leave denial from
								MetLife and AA Management — and
								won. It deepened her understanding of the importance of strong support systems and the
								power of direct action. She is
								eager to bring these values to union leadership.
							</p>
							<p>
								A proud New Yorker, Kassie lives in Harlem with her husband and family. She believes
								that together, we can create a stronger, more inclusive, and more supportive union for
								everyone.
