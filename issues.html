								<h2>Policies and Platform</h2>
								<p>Vote for a slate you can TRUST</p>
							</header>
							<section>
								<header>
									<h3>Transparency</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									Union members deserve to know how your leadership is working for you. That's why
									we're committed to putting out regular
									base briefs communicating what is happening in NYC.
								</p>

							</section>

							<section>
								<header>
									<h3>Reliability</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									We all deserve a union we can rely on for support and factual information when we
									need it most. Were dedicated to being
									there for you and getting back to you within 24 hours.
								</p>
							</section>

							<section>
								<header>
									<h3>Unity</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									We are stronger together! We've worked hard on the contract action team to build
									unity within our membership, and we
									aren't done yet. We have plans to continue building unity to harness our power and
									make meaningful change for flight
									attendants in New York.
								</p>
							</section>

							<section>
								<header>
									<h3>Solidarity</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									The labor movement is strong, and were stronger when we're connected to them. We've
									built relationships with other labor
									unions and elected officials and will continue to collaborate on topics that matter
									to flight attendants.
								</p>
							</section>

							<section>
								<header>
									<h3>Teamwork</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									This base cannot be run alone. We’re committed to building a strong coalition to
									serve the membership of New York,
									including opportunities for members to get involved with the union.
								</p>

						<!-- KEY ISSUES -->
						<article class="box post">
							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img class="issues" src="images/emily.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<header>
								<h2>Key Issues</h2>
								<p>These are the key issues we’ve identified at base,
									as your base leaders, these are our commitments to you:</p>
							</header>
							<section>
								<header>
									<h3>Communication</h3>
								</header>
								<ul>
									<li>24 Hour Response Time</li>
									<li>Consistent base-wide communication</li>
									<li>Increased availability of base reps</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									In a 24/7 operation in the city that never sleeps, you should be able to reach union
									representation when you need it.
									Our existing reps work hard to support their fellow crew members, and we commit to
									taking that even further. You’ll
									receive a response within 24 hours of contacting local council. Period. We might not
									have answers for you yet, but you
									won’t be left in the dark wondering if your communication has reached anyone.
								</p>

								<p>
									Members have the right to know how their elected representatives are working on
									their
									behalf. We will publish regular
									base briefs detailing the work our team is doing for NYC, including the number of
									open and completed grievances, and
									remain accountable to our members. If we are seeing the same problem come up
									consistently, that presents an opportunity
									to equip flight attendants with tools to prevent these problems and stand their
									ground on contractual violations.
								</p>

							</section>

							<section>
								<header>
									<h3>Representation</h3>
								</header>

								<ul>
									<li>Increased number of active base reps</li>
									<li>Increased opportunities for union involvement and collaboration</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									We will foster a culture of collaboration and inclusion, and grow the team that NYC
									needs. Within the first 6 months of
									taking office, we will further build and invest in our team of Base Council
									Representatives. This will create
									opportunities for more members to get involved, share the workload equitably while
									increasing coverage and availability
									for our members, and ensure that every member who needs it receives unbiased,
									efficient, and timely representation.
								</p>
							</section>

							<section>
								<header>
									<h3>Empowerment</h3>
								</header>
								<ul>
									<li>Contract training and resources, grievance workshops</li>
									<li>Identify contract specialists for quick answers to contract questions</li>
									<li>Empower future leaders of APFA</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									We’ll always have your back. One of the most important ways we will do that is by
									empowering you with the confidence to
									know, use, and enforce our contract yourself. Through live contract trainings,
									workshops, and helping you understand the
									hows and whys of the grievance process, we will become an even more united and
									educated workforce.
								</p>
								<p>
									Make no mistake. In the current political climate, the bastions of corporate greed
									will feel emboldened. But “Inform,
									don’t enforce” is for passengers using the lav when the seatbelt sign is on. It
									isn’t for management thinking they can
									get away with trampling the rights of workers. We’re going to have to be smart,
									savvy, and stick together. But we can do
									it.
								</p>
								<p>
									Change in leadership can present a challenge with lost knowledge in administration
									turnover. That is why we are
									dedicated to empowering the next generation of union leaders so knowledge is not
									lost. Succession planning starting on
									day one is necessary to ensure the future leaders of APFA are prepared to take on
									the company. We are committed to true,
									member-first, member-led democracy, not a clique accessible to only a select few.
								</p>

									<h3>Health & Safety</h3>
								</header>
								<ul>
									<li>Streamline and demystify state wide benefits</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									One of the ways NYC is uniquely positioned to fight back against management’s
									attempts to encroach on the well-being of
									labor are the protections afforded to us by NY State and the City. There are unique
									programs available to NYC flight
									attendants, like New York Paid Family Leave, New York Paid Prenatal Leave, and New
									York Maternity Disability.
								</p>

								<p>
									The problem is knowing how to navigate and combine these programs with existing
									contractual and company provisions. We
									will have a dedicated health and maternity coordinator on our team to help
									synthesize the options into a cohesive plan
									of action tailored to each flight attendant’s specific needs.
								</p>

								<p>
									Whether you’re caring for an aging parent or sick sibling, are navigating
									reproductive health issues, or in the midst of
									adoption, you have options and resources. We know what it’s like to cry on the phone
									with MetLife, trying to get paid so
									you can pay rent, while your newborn is screaming in the hospital bed next to you.
									You shouldn’t have to do that alone.
								</p>
							</section>

							<section>
								<header>
									<h3>Solidarity</h3>
								</header>
								<ul>
									<li>Engage with the larger labor movement</li>
									<li>Lobby elected officials for legislation benefiting flight attendants</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									While our primary responsibility will always be to the flight attendants of NYC,
									we’ve seen through our recent contract
									fight that the labor movement is stronger when we all stick together. We’ve worked
									hard to develop relationships with
									fellow labor leaders and elected officials. We intend to leverage these
									relationships to strengthen the labor movement
									and get laws passed that benefit both flight attendants and all other workers in New
									York. </p>
